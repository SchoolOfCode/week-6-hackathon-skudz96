/*  
    Hello challenger! Here are your instructions:
    You are given 5 words, each assigned with a number -

                3 => Purple
                5 => Burglar
                7 => Alarm

    Your task is to write a function named "tongueTwister" which takes in a number as parameters. This number indicates the maximum number the function will increment to. E.g. if n = 50, the function will return 1-50.

    Every number that is divisible by 3, will instead return "bold" as a string. Every number that is divisible by 5 will instead return "bugs", and so on. 

    Most importantly: ANY OVERLAPS IN DIVISIBLE NUMBERS HAVE TO PRINT BOTH WORDS. For example, if 15 was to be returned, 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5, so it will instead return "bold-bugs"
*/

// Main function others will solve
export function tongueTwister(n) {

}

// Ignore these, copilot suggestions. Maybe come back to them though
/* // Wrapper function suggested by copilot to include error handling
export function tongueTwisterWrapper(numOne, numTwo) {
  if (typeof numOne !== "number" || typeof numTwo !== "number") {
    throw new Error("Not a number");
  }
  return tongueTwister(numOne, numTwo);
}
